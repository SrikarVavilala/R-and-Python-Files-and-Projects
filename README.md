The folders contained in the repository contain both programming and project files for Python3+ and R respectively. This work was done in the Jupyter Notebook and RStudio platforms.

Some files are guided notes, with others being projects that were created and worked on with example/test datasets. They both cover a wide variety of topics and their respective implementations. This directory will be added to over time.
