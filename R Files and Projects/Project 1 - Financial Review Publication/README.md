Introduction and Applied Ideas:

For this project, I take supplied data and prepare/processe it so that visualizations can be drafted from it. From a technical 
standpoint, I experimented with various means of formatting and processing data in dataframes, using functions/ideas including the following:
- Reformatting columns as factors
- Understanding Factor Variable Traps
- Using sub() and gsub() to reformat data to a more desireable format
- Understanding and dealing with NA values
- Filtering, removing, and replacing missing data via Factual Analysis, Median Imputation, and Deriving Values
- Creating scatterplots and boxplots to visuzalize data

Project Overview:

With an aggregated list of Fortune 500 companies* (including revenue, expenses, profit, growth, etc. data), visualizations were drafted in accordance with 
the following charts:

• A scatterplot classified by industry showing revenue, expenses, profit

• A scatterplot that includes industry trends for the expenses~revenue relationship

• BoxPlots showing growth by industry

*Note that the dataset has numerous discrepancies that need to be addressed before analysis can be performed.

Final Thoughts and Overall Understanding:

Overall, I learned a lot about data preparation, processing, and visualizations using dataframes and ggplot2. Being able to "clean up" data and present it in a way that
allows for simple visual understanding are important tools for anyone working in the field of Data Science and Analytics, and I believe I have adequately done so here.
